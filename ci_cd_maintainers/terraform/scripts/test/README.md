# Testing the GitHub Webhook Management Script

This directory contains tools for testing the webhook management script locally before using it in production.

## Prerequisites

1. A GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) with appropriate permissions:
   - For public repositories: `public_repo` scope
   - For private repositories: `repo` scope
   - You can create a token at: https://github.com/settings/tokens

2. Required tools:
   - `curl`
   - `jq`
   - Bash shell

## Test Files

- `test_repos.txt`: Sample list of repositories to test with
- `test_script.sh`: Test runner script with validation capabilities

## How to Test

### 1. Edit the Repository List

Edit `test_repos.txt` to include repositories you want to test. The default file includes some popular public repositories, but for a thorough test, include repositories that:

- You own
- You have collaborator access to
- You don't have access to

This will help verify that the validation is working correctly.

```
your-org/your-repo
your-username/your-personal-repo
public-org/public-repo
```

### 2. Run Validation Only (Recommended)

To test the script's validation functionality without creating any webhooks:

```bash
./test_script.sh YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN
```

This will:
- Validate your GitHub token
- Check access to each repository
- Verify admin permissions where needed
- Report any issues without creating webhooks

### 3. Test Creating Webhooks (Optional)

To test creating actual webhooks:

```bash
./test_script.sh YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN create
```

> **Warning**: This will create real webhooks on the repositories you have access to!

The test uses `https://example.com/webhook` as the webhook URL, which won't receive any events (it's not a real endpoint).

### 4. Test Deleting Webhooks (Cleanup)

If you created webhooks with the previous step:

```bash
./test_script.sh YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN delete
```

This will remove any webhooks pointing to the test URL.

## Understanding Test Results

The test script provides color-coded output:
- üü¢ Green: Success
- üî¥ Red: Errors
- üü° Yellow: Warnings
- üîµ Blue: Information

## Troubleshooting

1. **Missing jq error**: Install jq with your package manager (e.g., `apt install jq`, `brew install jq`)

2. **Token permission errors**: Ensure your token has the correct scopes

3. **Repository access issues**: Make sure you have the correct permissions on the repositories
